Hello

This respository contains the project report and code for an algorithmic music composition program called Project ProNote, which was created by myself for a Computing A Level extended project.
It was created using C#.net in Visual Studio 2012.

It achieved very high marks and was worked on between September 2015 and March 2016.

The report, which was the assignment submission, is the file called A2 COMP4 Project Ross Duncan. Please read this document first. It is available in both .docx and .pdf format.

The other files are the source code from the original Visual Studio solution. No modifications have been made since the assignment was submitted.

Thanks and happy reading.
Ross
